# The Future Project
Transform school.

# Everyone knows high school is broken.
But why does anyone think obsessing about test scores will fix it?

# "If you don't love it, you're going to fail."
-	Steve Jobs

# The problem with high school is that it's awful.
It's stale, it's stifling, and sometimes vicious. Who can love that?

# So isn't it obvious what needs doing?
Why do we put students in a place they can't love and expect them to excel? 

# The Future Project transforms high school into somewhere great. 
We make it a place you can't wait to come to and don't want to leave; a placeÂ that values taking risks; a place that unleashes students' passion and power.
